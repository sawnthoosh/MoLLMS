# MoLLMS
A Mixture of LLMs architecture for routing prompts to specialized expert models.
# ðŸ§  MoLLM: Mixture of Large Language Models

**MoLLM** (Mixture of LLMs) is a novel architecture that intelligently routes user queries to specialized language models, optimizing for **efficiency**, **accuracy**, and **domain expertise**. Inspired by the **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** paradigm, MoLLM breaks away from the "one-size-fits-all" approach by orchestrating multiple fine-tuned LLMs through a central intelligent router.

## ðŸš€ Vision

General-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini are versatile, but they struggle with highly specialized tasks. MoLLM solves this by:

- **Routing each query** to the best-fit LLM based on its domain (e.g., code, writing, data).
- **Using expert models** that are fine-tuned for individual use-cases.
- **Reducing compute cost** by avoiding overuse of massive generalist models.

## ðŸ§° System Components

### 1. **ðŸ§­ Header (Intelligent Router)**
- Analyzes user input to detect task type and domain.
- Maps input to the correct expert LLM.
- Acts as the central "brain" of the system.

### 2. **ðŸŽ“ Expert LLMs**
Each model is independently trained for a specific domain:
- **Model 1:** Coding & Web Development
- **Model 2:** Creative Writing
- **Model 3:** Data Analysis
- **Model 4:** Technical Documentation
- **Model X:** Generalist (fallback)
